Book Flow is an online marketplace for used books, built with the MERN Stack and other technologies like Tailwind CSS and Axios. It offers a user-friendly interface for account creation, posting book ads, and direct buyer-seller communication. A standout feature is the local seller search, leveraging location data for convenient transactions. The platform employs token-based authentication for security, and APIs for external service integration. This project demonstrates my expertise in full-stack development and commitment to creating practical, user-focused web solutions.
